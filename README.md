# MM-net EIP implementation
Enterprise Integration Pattern (EIP) demonstrator as multimedia CPN extension of CPNTools

## System Requirements

1. Windows 10 (due to the CPN Tools, sorry guys)
2. Working internet connection
3. JDK15 (eg, from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk15-archive-downloads.html))
4. CPN Tools version 4 (eg, from [CPN Tools](http://cpntools.org/2018/01/16/download/))
5. Recommended: Cygwin to install further needed dependencies (JavaCV 1.5.4, OpenCV 4.4.0) and to start the extension.
    * Needed tools: `make`, `wget`, `unzip`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`
    * Run `make`: Downloading dependencies will take some time and around 2.5 GB of disk space
    * The JVM is configured to take up to 6GB of memory

## Simulating the patterns

1. Run the `mmnet.jar` to start the extension server (`make`);
check the icon in the toolbar and double-click to check that the mm-net
extension is registered. Make sure that the command is executed within the
folder, such that the HaarCascade subdirectory is at the relative path
`./HaarCascade`, allowing the extension to find relevant files.
2. start the CPN Tools (eg, type CPN Tools in Win10 search field).
3. Load pattern model, e.g., `aggregator.cpn`, through right-click and `load model`.

4. Right click on the `connect` artifact in the model and select `excecute ML`
**OR** select ML in the CPN Toolbar and drag and drop there.

5. Enter the port configured in the connect artifact into the extension GUI and connect CPN/COMM (default `9001`).

6. Start executing enabled transitions.

## Tips and Tricks
- If images are loaded but places and or viewplaces are not populated, changing
  the inscription (e.g. adding a space) will lead to a recalculation, allowing
  to display the correct tokens.
- Sometimes even though transitions should be able to fire they are not enabled,
  saving the current net sometimes seems to *release* the internal confusion
  of CPN Tools, which may lead to correctly enabled transitions.
- Large sized pictures can need a longer time to be classified, most of the time using a
  downscaled image will yield the same classification in less time

## License

Please note that the demonstrator is a CPN Tools extension, and thus uses the [Access/CPN](http://cpntools.org/2018/01/15/license-for-access-cpn/) module, which comes with a LGPL license. However, Access/CPN references the [CPN Tools Simulator](http://cpntools.org/2018/01/15/license-for-cpn-tools-simulator/) module, which is dual-licensed and can be used either under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or by the below license, which is a 4-clause BSD license.
